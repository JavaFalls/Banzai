The icons here are optimized SVGs, because the editor renders the svgs at runtime, they need
to be small in size, so they can be efficiently parsed.

The original icons can be found at:
https://github.com/djrm/godot-design/tree/master/assets/icons

There you can find the optimizer script.

If you add a new icon, please make a pull request to this repo:
https://github.com/djrm/godot-design/

and store the the optimized SVG version here.
